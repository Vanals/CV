# Marco Vanali

I am a frontend web developer from Sardinia, Italy. My journey began when I was building and managing a website for nursing students ( http://www.lostudenteim.it) while achieving a Nursing Degree. Between a pathology and another, I realized my passion lied in coding as I thoroughly enjoyed studying HTML and CSS. After graduation in nursing, I ventured to the UK to pursue my passion for web development. With hard work, I got accepted into Makers Academy to train as a developer and stepped forth into working as a front end developer for MMT Digital, now based at the Vodafone London office.

- I've had the opportunity to work with a variety of projects such as nqa.com, myfamilypet.co.uk and vodafone.co.uk
- I've worked in a team of 12 that has taught me the collaboration skills of how a project gets built from zero to release.
- My communication skills also have been progressing as I've had to work with different staff members; like product owner, scrum master, UX/UI, back end teams and more.
Also every two weeks, me and my team demo our progresses.

## Skills

### Attention to Detail
Studying at a Nursing school, the skills required one to be precise in procedures for patients. One of them was the administration of drugs.
Joined at MMT Digital one of my first tasks was styling different area of NQA web site (https://www.nqa.com/en-gb/global). The styling had to be pixel perfect. I loved it!

### Fast Learner
Several weeks at the coding bootcamp, Makers Academy tests this skill constantly whether it'd be a new framework or language. However, a memorable achievement was when I was able to build a thermostat app and a bowling game after learning Javascript in less than 48 hours. It not only tested my ability to memorise or pick up the language quickly, but also tested my ability to apply this to the my logic for building these apps.

### Persistent
Whilst I was working at a hospital in the UK, I was driven for my goal of getting a place at Makers. This required me to study a new coding language, Ruby in less than two weeks. With hard work and determination for my goal, the achievement of getting a place at Makers was a one to remember. I believe my will to fly overseas alone, to adapt to a new environment and crowds proves the persistence for achieving my passion.
In addition, during my nursing studies I made and managed a blog for nursing students (http://www.lostudenteim.it/)
Finally, I can say I am very self development focused!

## Education

#### Makers Academy (SEPT 2017 - JAN 2018)
Makers Academy is one of the best coding bootcamps in Europe. It is a highly intense course that places a heavy emphasis on not just coding languages but on practices such pair programming, test driven development, object-oriented design and learning to learn. 

During the course I had experiences with:

- Languages: Javascript (JQuery, React), Ruby, Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS, SQL.
- Testing Frameworks: Rspec, Jasmine, Mocha, Chai, Sinon.
- Practices: TDD, XP, AGILE.

#### UNIVERSITY OF CAGLIARI / ITALY(SEPT 2011 - APRIL 2016)
Nursing (BA) at University of Cagliari, Sardinia, Italy

## Experience

**MMT Digital (From MAY 2018)**  <br>
In the first months, I worked in the NQA project where I had mainly the responsibility of building HTML responsive pages and styling pixel perfect client's design. At the same time, I had the opportunity to develop using React.

★ Since then, I have been given the opportunity to work full time in the Vodafone project. In an agile environment with a new team, we've developed from scratch the new checkout path for Vodafone.

I am still now daily working with Javascript, React, MobX, HTML, CSS and APIs. I write clean, tested an reusable code using the best known practices.
The code is tested using Jest, Enzyme and other internal screenshots tools.
The daily practice include create complex tested components following Atomic Design principles, implementing MOBX state management, styling pixel perfect the components in base of the design given.

I have also been involved in building the JSON validation logic using the AJV library and won an internal hackathlon using vanilla javascript, pair programming with juniors.
In order to progress with my job I communicate and collaborate with other staff members: UX/UI, backend team, scrum master, product owner, testers etc. We also demo every two weeks our progresses.
