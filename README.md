# Marco Vanali

I am a Full Stack Web Developer and I come from Sardinia, Italy. This journey of mine began when I was managing a Wordpress website for nursing students (http://www.lostudenteim.it) whilst on a Nursing Degree. Between a pathology and another, I realised my passion for coding through my enjoyment of studying HTML and CSS.

Having this realisation after graduating in nursing, I decided to venture to UK to follow my new passion.

While I was working full time in a hospital in the UK, with hard-work and immense research, I got accepted into Makers Academy. One of the most discerning development bootcamps in Europe. I aim to work in a dynamic environment, working with creative self-learning people that focuses on developing mobile APPs or Websites.

## Skills

### Attention to Detail
Studying at a Nursing school, the skills required one to be precise in procedures for patients. One of them was the administration of drugs. I scored 105/110 for my overall degree. On top of that, I developed and managed a social page/website for nursing students, which needed one to be organised, allocating proper content and scheduling timetables for the community.

### Fast Learner
Several weeks at the coding bootcamp, Makers Academy tests this skill constantly whether it'd be a new framework or language. However, a memorable achievement was when I was able to build a thermostat app and a bowling game after learning Javascript in less than 48 hours. It not only tested my ability to memorise or pick up the language quickly, but also tested my ability to apply this to the my logic for building these apps.

### Persistent
Whilst I was working at a hospital in the UK, I was driven for my goal of getting a place at Makers. This required me to study a new coding language, Ruby in less than two weeks. With hard work and determination for my goal, the achievement of getting a place at Makers was a one to remember. I believe my will to fly overseas alone, to adapt to a new environment and crowds proves the persistence for achieving my passion.
In addition, during my nursing studies I made and managed a blog for nursing students (http://www.lostudenteim.it/)
