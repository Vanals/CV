# Marco Vanali

Frontend Web Developer from a beautiful island called Sardinia, Italy. My journey began when I was building and managing a website for nursing students (http://www.lostudenteim.it) whilst on a Nursing Degree. Between a pathology and another, I realised my passion for coding through my enjoyment of studying HTML and CSS

Having  this  realisation  after  graduating  in  nursing,  I  ventured  to  UK  to  follow  my  new  passion.  With  hard-work  and  immense research,I got accepted into Makers Academy to train as a developer. 
Now I work for MMT Digital at the Vodafone office, full time. 
Since September 2018 I’ve joined a wonderful team which had the aim to re build from scratch the checkout journey.
I work in an agile environment and greenfield project. Daily communicating with other teams, scrum master, project owner, UX/UI, tester, and teammate. Plus, every two weeks we demo our progresses. 

Now looking for new challenges. Passionate of great user experiences.

## Tech stack I use daily

## Skills

### Attention to Detail
Studying at a Nursing school, the skills required one to be precise in procedures for patients. One of them was the administration of drugs.
Joined at MMT Digital one of my first tasks was styling different area of NQA web site (https://www.nqa.com/en-gb/global). The styling had to be pixel perfect. I loved it!

### Fast Learner
Several weeks at the coding bootcamp, Makers Academy tests this skill constantly whether it'd be a new framework or language. However, a memorable achievement was when I was able to build a thermostat app and a bowling game after learning Javascript in less than 48 hours. It not only tested my ability to memorise or pick up the language quickly, but also tested my ability to apply this to the my logic for building these apps.

### Persistent
Whilst I was working at a hospital in the UK, I was driven for my goal of getting a place at Makers. This required me to study a new coding language, Ruby in less than two weeks. With hard work and determination for my goal, the achievement of getting a place at Makers was a one to remember. I believe my will to fly overseas alone, to adapt to a new environment and crowds proves the persistence for achieving my passion.
In addition, during my nursing studies I made and managed a blog for nursing students (http://www.lostudenteim.it/)
Finally, I can say I am very self development focused!
